Calculate the trajectory of the motion of a body thrown at an angle to the horizon, provided that the body,
in addition to the force of gravity, also acts on the strength of air resistance.
Assume that in the atmosphere, depending on the height above the surface,
the force of air resistance is different: in the first lower layer it is proportional to the square of the velocity of the body (and is directed against the velocity vector),
in the second central layer, the air resistance force is proportional to the speed of the body, and in the third,
the upper layer of the atmosphere, the force of air resistance is absent.
