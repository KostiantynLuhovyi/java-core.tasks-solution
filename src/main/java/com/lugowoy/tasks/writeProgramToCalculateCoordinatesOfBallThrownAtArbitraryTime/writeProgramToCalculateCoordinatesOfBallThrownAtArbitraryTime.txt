The elastic ball is thrown at an angle to the horizon at some initial velocity.
When the ball falls on a flat horizontal surface, there is an elastic beating, so that the horizontal component of the speed of the ball does not change,
and the vertical component changes to the opposite one.
It is necessary to write a program that calculates the position (coordinates) of the ball at any time.
