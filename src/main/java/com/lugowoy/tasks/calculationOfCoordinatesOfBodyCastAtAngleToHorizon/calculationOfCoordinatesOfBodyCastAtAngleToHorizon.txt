Write a program for calculating the coordinate time at the specified time body, thrown at an angle to the horizon.
We assume that the mass of the body m is known, the initial velocity V, the angle a, under which the body is thrown to the horizon.
In addition, we believe that the body acts as an air resistance force, modulo proportional to the speed of the body and directed opposite to the direction of flight of the body.
