# Solution_Tasks_For_Java_Fundamentals
In this repository you will find a lot of solved tasks on topics related to different sections of programming.
The solutions are implemented in the object-oriented Java programming language.
------------------------------------
The structure of the project folders is taken from the BAT Maven structure.
The root package is com.lugowoy.
------------------------------------
In the package com.lugowoy.tasks are packages and classes of solving tasks.
--------------------
Each task is placed in a separate package.
The task description is in the package with the classes for solving the problem, in the file with the package name and with the extension .txt

Description package:
- com.lugowoy.tasks.algorithms - Solved tasks using various algorithms.
- com.lugowoy.tasks.arrays - Solved tasks concerning arrays of different sizes.
- com.lugowoy.tasks.core - Solved tasks concerning various elementary programming topics.
- —Åom.lugowoy.tasks.oop. - Solved tasks concerning the use of object-oriented programming concepts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the package com.lugowoy.helper there are packages that encapsulate classes that implement different supporting functions for solving tasks.
--------------------
Description com.lugowoy.helper package:
- com.lugowoy.helper.calculating - Encapsulates functions for performing mathematical calculations.
- com.lugowoy.helper.converting - Encapsulates the minimum hierarchy for performing the conversion of the data of a concrete object.
- com.lugowoy.helper.factory - Encapsulates a hierarchy of classes that implement the factory for constructing objects of different types.
- com.lugowoy.helper.filling - Encapsulates a hierarchy of classes that implement the filling of different data structures and objects with data.
- com.lugowoy.helper.models - Encapsulates a class hierarchy to provide different object models for solving tasks.
- com.lugowoy.helper.generating - Encapsulates a static hierarchy for generating pseudo-random data.
- com.lugowoy.helper.reading - Encapsulates a class hierarchy that implements the functionality of reading and processing user input.
- com.lugowoy.helper.util - Encapsulates supporting classes that help in solving problems, but the hierarchy of classes to which they belonged is not yet built.
