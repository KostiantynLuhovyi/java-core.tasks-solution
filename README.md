In this repository you will find many tasks solutions  on the topics of Java programming language.

For example the construction of a project folder structure is taken from the BAT framework Maven.

The root is the package com.lugowoy.

------------------------------------
In the package com.lugowoy.tasks are solvable task.
--------------------
Each task is placed in a separate package.
Task description is in the package with the classes for the solution of the task, in a file with the name of the package and the extension .txt

Description package:
- com.lugowoy.tasks.core. - in this package tasks on basic programming topics.
- com.lugowoy.tasks.array. - in this package task on arrays.
- —Åom.lugowoy.tasks.oop. - in this package tasks on basic oop topics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the package com.lugowoy.util are util classes separated into packages for different implementation.
