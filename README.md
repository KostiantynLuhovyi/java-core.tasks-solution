# java-core.tasks-solution  
**In this repository are located solutions to tasks written in the Java programming language on the core programming topics.**  

The hierarchy (nesting) of packets is based on the classical packet structure, which is used in BAT Maven.  

The name of the packages in which the classes are located to solve the task is the approximate condition of the task.  

A complete description of the task you can see in the package with the solution of the problem in a file with the same name and file extension .txt  .  

Many of functional solutions are implemented in the java-helper.jar library classes. 
A detailed description of the functional contained in the library "java-helper.jar" and used for solving tasks can be found 
in the repository by the link: https://github.com/LugowoyKonstantin/java-helper.tasks-solution
